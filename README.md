    1. I have used react.js to handle client side UI.
  
    2. Used axios. It is a promised-based HTTP client for JavaScript.
  
    3. For client side route management I have used react-router-dom.
    
    4. react-toastify is used to show success/error message.
    
    5. react-bootstrap is used to show modal.
